# llama-smart-proxy Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Object-Oriented Programming
All code must follow object-oriented principles: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. Classes should be well-designed with clear responsibilities, single responsibility principle, and proper separation of concerns.

### II. Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS)
Solutions must be as simple as possible. Avoid unnecessary complexity; prefer straightforward implementations over clever ones. Complexity must be justified and documented.

### III. Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
Eliminate code duplication. Reuse code through functions, classes, or modules. Changes should be made in one place only. Abstract common patterns into reusable components.

## Additional Constraints

Technology stack: Python preferred with type hints. Compliance with PEP 8 style guide. Use virtual environments for dependency management. Minimum Python version 3.8.

## Development Workflow

Code review required for all changes. Use git for version control with descriptive commit messages. Follow test-driven development where applicable. Document complex logic and APIs.

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require consensus and documentation. All code must comply with principles; violations must be justified. Version control follows semantic versioning. Regular reviews ensure compliance.
